  <p class="break">Huge success!</p>
  <p class="break">It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.</p>
  <p>Aperture Science:</p>
  <p>We do what we must because we can.</p>
  <p>For the good of all of us.</p>
  <p class="break">Except the ones who are dead.</p>
  <p>But there's no sense crying over every mistake.</p>
  <p class="break">You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake.</p>
  <p>And the science gets done.</p>
  <p>And you make a neat gun.</p>
  <p class="break">For the people who are still alive.</p>
